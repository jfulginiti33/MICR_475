![The good plot](C:\Users\Owner\Pictures\Micr475_goodplot.JPG)

We see the relative abundance of major bacterial groups in four sites that vary in age. The categorial data is unordered, and is displayed using the geom_bar() function.

![The bad plot](C:\Users\Owner\Pictures\Micr475_badplot.JPG)

We see the population densities for total bacteria, culturable bacteria, and Fe-oxidizers in each of the four sites over a 6 year period. I think this is a bad plot because the information doesn't really display a particular trend over a 6 year period. It's also a bit clustered and harder to interpret at first. The biigest issue I have with this plot is that the data is incomplete, in that the number of samples take over the 6 year period varies for each site.

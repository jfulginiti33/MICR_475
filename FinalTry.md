![The good
plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfulginiti33/MICR_475/main/HW6%20images/Micr475_goodplot.png)

We see the relative abundance of major bacterial groups in four sites
that vary in age. The categorial data is unordered, and is displayed
using the geom\_bar() function.

![The bad
plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfulginiti33/MICR_475/main/HW6%20images/Micr475_badplot.png)

We see the population densities for total bacteria, culturable bacteria,
and Fe-oxidizers in each of the four sites over a 6 year period. I think
this is a bad plot because the information doesn’t really display a
particular trend over a 6 year period. It’s also a bit clustered and
harder to interpret at first. The biigest issue I have with this plot is
that the data is incomplete, in that the number of samples take over the
6 year period varies for each site.

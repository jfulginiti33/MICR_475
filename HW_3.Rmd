```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#mpg is a package under tidyverse
```

Intro
```{r}
#I am curious about model vs highway milage
#loading tidyverse and mpg
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
#viewing mpg data
head(mpg)



```
# creating plot displaying "model vs highway milage"
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = model, y = hwy))
#important note: x axis is a bit clustered... Will need to learn how to edit this problem.
# I was trying to view which model had the best highway mileage, and view trends to see if a particular maker had the best highway mileage
```
